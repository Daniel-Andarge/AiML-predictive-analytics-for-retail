# Predictive Analytics For Retail

## Project Description

This project represents a strategic initiative for Rossmann Pharmaceuticals, with the potential to significantly enhance the company's overall performance and competitiveness in the market.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Virtual environment (e.g., `virtualenv`, `conda`)
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   ```
2. Change to the project directory:
   ```
   cd your-project
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```
   # Using virtualenv
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

   # Using conda
   conda create -n your-env python=3.x
   conda activate your-env
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Start the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open the relevant notebooks:
   - `data_understanding.ipynb`
   - `data_cleaning.ipynb`
   - `feature_engineering.ipynb`
   - `eda.ipynb`
   - `model_building.ipynb`

Each notebook corresponds to a step in the data analysis process, as outlined in the introduction.

## Data Storage and Versioning

This project uses DVC (Data Version Control) for managing and versioning the dataset files. The data files are stored in the `data/` directory, and the corresponding `.dvc` files are used to track and version the dataset changes.

Here's the overall structure of the project:

```
your_project/
├── .dvc/
│   ├── config
│   ├── plots/
│   ├── tmp/
│   ├── original_data.csv.dvc
│   ├── cleaned_data.csv.dvc
│   └── engineered_data.csv.dvc
├── data/
│   ├── original_data.csv
│   ├── cleaned_data.csv
│   └── engineered_data.csv
├── notebooks/
│   ├── data_understanding.ipynb
│   ├── data_cleaning.ipynb
│   ├── feature_engineering.ipynb
│   ├── eda.ipynb
│   └── model_building.ipynb
├── models/
├── .gitignore
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

To interact with the DVC-managed dataset, you can use the following commands:

1. **Initialize DVC**: Start by initializing a DVC repository in your project directory, which will allow you to track and version your data files.

2. **Track the Original Dataset**: Add the original dataset file (`original_data.csv`) to DVC using the `dvc add` command. This will create a corresponding `.dvc` file that represents the dataset.

3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: After applying data cleaning and preprocessing, save the cleaned dataset (`cleaned_data.csv`) using DVC. This will create a new version of the dataset in your DVC repository.

4. **Feature Engineering**: When performing feature engineering, save the engineered dataset (`engineered_data.csv`) using DVC, creating another version of the dataset.

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis and Model Building**: In the subsequent steps, you can load the appropriate dataset versions (e.g., `cleaned_data.csv` or `engineered_data.csv`) directly from the DVC repository.

By maintaining this structure, you can effectively manage the versioning and traceability of your datasets, making it easier to reproduce your data analysis workflows and collaborate on your project over time.

## Scripts and Notebooks

The project is organized into the following scripts and Jupyter Notebooks:

1. **Data Understanding**:

   - `data_understanding.ipynb`

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:

   - `data_cleaning.ipynb`

3. **Feature Engineering**:

   - `feature_engineering.ipynb`

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

   - `eda.ipynb`

5. **Model Building**:
   - `model_building.ipynb`

Each notebook corresponds to a step in the data analysis process, as outlined in the introduction.
